On the second night of taking the medicine he woke up having an over 7 minute seizure and stopped breathing during one of the clusters. His seizures were lasting 1 to 2 minutes prior and he has never stopped breathing. I had to call 911 which I&#039;ve never had to do before. It was very scary. We have dropped out of the trial.

93174,"""This medication is an absolute waste of time. I have been on Invega for a little less than 2 years now and I can with absolute confidence ascertain that it has done nothing for me. Aside from the decrease in sexual appetite and libido, difficulty having and maintaining erections, little to no ejaculatory fluid (which is really frustrating btw), the muscle tremors I am experiencing, and the 30 pounds I have gained since starting this medication , it is with no doubt an absolute and total waste of money. I definitely would not recommend this medication to anyone. Save yourselves the time and money and DO NOT take this medication.""",1

My Neuro tried different doses at different times of the day, it would only work with Sinemet to help kickstart at first, after about a week it was no longer predictable. Several times I had to crawl because I could not walk, once I got up to go the bathroom but could not cross the threshold and had to urinate on the floor. The last day my Neuro asked me to try 4 capsules at once as a last resort, It was 2 hours before I could get out of bed!

Side effects: cramping/pain, mood swings, back pain, vaginal infection...which I just found out after a month of having this thing in I have BV. I literally just pulled it out on my own since my Dr. refused to remove it and kept convincing me to keep it in just because my side effects are slightly better. DO NOT GET AN IUD. Remember, Drs. profit off of RX&rsquo;s. I refuse to suffer for longer than a month.

Shortly after, I started suffering with depression and body confidence issues and my interest in food disappeared all together.

99304,"""Total scam. 

I&#039;ve been on this drug for 3 years. Since being on it, It caused acute arm paralysis, dystonia, difficulty speaking, delirium which lasted for a month and it caused weight gain and man boobs.

When I first received the shot, it felt like my brain was about to explode.

I had extremely high blood pressure on this medicine- 178/105. After I stopped it, my blood pressure is 110/78.

I experienced temporal lobe damage from this medicine and a CT scan showed atrophy of my brain after I stopped taking it.

Be careful- many psychiatrists receive grants and stipends from big pharma and receive extra insurance money to peddle more drugs to as many patients as possible.

This is because of our fee-for-service healthcare system.""",1

The whole PE / pneumonia thing is still utterly unreal to us - still in a daze, trying to figure out what it means for lifestyle changes. 

Since they switched me from Coumadin IV to Xarelto in the hospital I have had a non-stop awful migraine, upper back and neck pain (muscular), some upset stomach. My lower jaw and teeth hurt - something I&#039;ve never experienced as I have no cavities at age 47; I can empathize with my husband&#039;s toothaches a bit now, unfortunately.

He ended up in the emergency room after he collapsed and lost a lot of blood from internal bleeding.  It also gave him a lot of gas and stomach upset.  I would not recommend for anyone to take it.

Gave it a try for 2.5 months and couldn&#039;t stand it any longer.  I&#039;ve been off the pil for a week and feel completely normal again- thank goodness. I had an minena IUD with hormones  for 5 years and believe that was giving me fatigue as well as it was slightly infected-  but at that stage I had a series of life challenges that could have accounted fatigue too.  It seems additional hormones do no suit me. Previous Oral birth control gave me severe depression.  Still searching.""",1

One night I took 1 right before bed like I always had and woke up the next morning with vomit all over my house and an empty pill bottle on my night stand. I took a heap 10mg of Ambien and had zero memory of doing this. It absolutely terrified me. I now take 100mg of doxepin and sleep through the night without a hangover in the morning.

It eventually developed to the point where I got hormonal acne on my forehead and chin, places I had NEVER gotten acne. I stayed on the pill for 3 months and couldn&#039;t take the acne any more, and the worst part is that the acne WORSENED after I got off. It has been four months and my face is filled with acne scars and new blemishes. This has been an ongoing battle for me, and I regret taking the pill. Immensely. Please avoid this at all costs!

I did not notice any benefits during my brief use.

I am also taking buproprion and did not adjust my dose after starting fetzima.. which I now realize I should have considered.

Second night had some mild numbness in my throat that I hadn&#039;t associated with the pill at all because the the first day had went well. Tonight, minutes after taking my pill, my lips feel very numb. No blue discoloration, trouble breathing, or heart palpitations. However, I do have some slight blurred vision, a stuffy chest feeling, and a bit of nausea. After some reading, I found that my last pill and this new one are two different variations of the pill. This new pill, Apri, is a combination pill that contains both estrogen and progestin. I may have had a drug allergy to the estrogen (I read this can happen) or an allergy to a dye in the pill. All I have on hand is some Allergra allergy pills so I took one of those about 30 minutes ago and, although I still feel a little weird, my lips are not as numb. Hopefully the symptoms disappear soon. I will definitely not be taking Apri again or any other combination pill.

When coming off/withdrawing SWIM can usually take a half to 3/4 8mg strip of subs (possibly a full strip if SWIM relapse is bad enough) and then they will feel fine. However they recently tried ZUBSOLV with the directions of only needing to take one ever so and so hours. After waiting the correct amount of time SWIM took the Zubsolv as instructed and soon after the withdraws came. After waiting an hour and a half the withdrawals had emerged with full on sweats, vomiting, etcetera so they took a second one and after about another hour the vomiting had stopped yet cold sweats and shaking were still present it wasn&#039;t until after a 3rd Zub was taking that my friend was even able to take a deep breath and finally sit up straight and not have to be in the restroom. And yet still had sleepless nights, finally went back to subs and after a half of one had no complaints. So if your thinking about switching don&#039;t. The taste may be better but wow who cares what it tastes like, it&#039;s about being able to function without withdrawals and without cravings.

86531,"""I would like to offer my personal experience of the nicotine nasal spray as I think potential users should be aware of the harsh reality of this product and the dangers of using this product. I do not think that anywhere in the internet provides a full and comprehensive review of this particular product. This product while satisfying the urges of nicotine withdrawal, has major potential to make the user dependent on the nasal spray. While the desire to smoke generally disappears, the addiction and dependence is on the spray. It is replacing one evil with another in my opinion. 
The spray has terrible side effects, which again are not fully disclosed anywhere on the internet in my opinion. I will go through the side effects:

1. Severe congestion unlike anything experienced with other NRT products. The spray causes chest and lung congestion as well as nasal congestion. Catarrh becomes immediate as soon as the spray is used. Even by using just one small spray in one nostril. Combatting the congestion becomes a daily chore and nightmare. Relying on cough medicines such as Guaifenesin, Actifed tablets - because the congestion and catarrh is so severe that it inhibits breathing. And sudafed nasal spray to unblock the nose. Again, a blocked nose is experienced immediately after just one spray in the nostril.

2. Immediately after using the spray, the catarrh is so bad that one must either spit it out in a sink or continuously carry tissues with them. Runny nose is a constant - immediately after using the spray but also some time after using the spray. Constantly having to wipe the nose results in skin chafing around the nasal passage area and outside the nostrils and in the worst case, bleeding around the nose. Resulting in again - having to constantly apply cream around the affected area. 

3. Perhaps the most severe and the most concerning - nose bleeds. Although some have reported that this only happens when they start using the spray, it is possible that nose bleeds continue on and off throughout the time of using the spray. Nose bleeds causes by irritation from the spray. Imagine a chemical that is so harsh and severe that it causes bleeding. This is shocking. 
However, the addiction and dependency on this spray becomes so uncontrollable and so strong that one persists with the spray despite nose bleeds. 

4. The psychological effects of this spray is another area that has been under reported. Although the spray provides an immediate sense of satisfaction and indeed &#039;stimulation&#039; as nicotine after all is a powerful stimulant, and in through the nasal passage it is absorbed at high speed of course, thus the effects of this are compelling and indeed enticing. However. The effects only last a few seconds. And then it goes. Leaving one wanting more and more of the spray. As a result the more one takes the less effective the spray becomes. It is a vicious and dangerous cycle. Psychologically one ends up in a state where they are very anxious and worry about where their next &#039;fix&#039; will come from. And what will happen if they don&#039;t have a spray, or run out of the spray in the middle of the night or find themselves in a place where the spray isn&#039;t available. The spray one the one hand definitely does stop smokers from smoking cigarettes and is probably the most effective NRT product in that sense, but creates a whole new set of anxieties that did not exist to this extent before. This psychological area needs to be further explored and served as a warning. 

5. The cost of the spray is extortionate, especially when compared to other NRT products. In the U.K. The price of the spray is around """,1

No topical medication is going to stop the herpes virus from running its course internally.  Only oral medications taken by mouth can shorten the cycle of the herpes virus when it sheds.  Personally, I take Acyclovir, prescribed by my dermatologist, upon feeling the first tingle of a herpes cold sore.  I have found that It cuts the cycle in half.  Other people prefer Valtrex.  If you want real results during a herpes outbreak, you need an oral medication.  Keep it handy in your prescription cabinet.  Not a topical cream.  Herpes is an internal virus.

I&#039;ve also found the generic is only slightly less expensive but the good there is it works just the same as Oracea there have been no differences in effectiveness.  On a somewhat different note, I went in for an eye exam and my opthmologist told me Oracea was a ripoff and a marketing gimmick and all I had to do was take a low dose of doxy twice a day with the same effect for a fraction of the cost.""",10

That&#039;s when I started Febuxostat.  Worked like a charm!  I&#039;m taking 40mg daily.  Uric acid is maintained at 5.5 mg/dl since then.  I was drinking water like crazy before to maintain uric acid - didn&#039;t help. Now, I&#039;m careless about water in-take, still uric acid levels are fine.  My doctor is very data driven, so we took baseline SGPT/SGOT (liver enzymes) test before starting the medication. Measured uric acid and liver enzymes again after 1 month, and then after 3 months.  No side effects on liver enzymes but uric acid level went down drastically. So, I love it!""",10

The MD prescribed 200mg of Wellbutrin SR which had a positive effect, yet did not get rid of the underlying thoughts of death and dying; many of you will understand that I&#039;m talking about a coping mechanism not actually wanting harm myself.  A pharmacist told me to ask my MD about Deplin and that was the best medical advice I&#039;ve ever received!

Nope, do not eat a meal, you will get nauseous. I do want to add that those who are more nauseous than others probably have more mucus in their stomach. Just my opinion.

Approximately 2.5 months in, the Botox wore off and migraines returned. Anxious to receive the next round and find some relief. It&#039;s a wonderful alternative to oral medication. Aside from some very mild soreness for a week, I have no side effects, even in my neck. It&#039;s the greatest preventative I&#039;ve ever been on. Just make sure a neurologist gives you the injections.""",10

Sertraline has really helped me to have some breathing space during this time and given me some mental clarity to make it through the day.

A typical breakout for me would consist of about 10-15 pimples and blackheads on my nose and chin area. I&#039;ve tried everything from antibiotics to creams/face washes. Nothing has ever helped me. When I turned 18 I decided I had enough with the acne game and decided to see a dermatologist. I was put me on spironolactone 100mg once a day. I took spironolactone for a few years and yes, it did help a lot. My face was finally clearing up and I was happy with the results. Fast forward 6 years and my acne slowly started coming back. I was getting breakouts on my cheeks/forehead and my blackheads were still present (mind you they never cleared up on spironolactone). 
A friend of mine started Accutane and saw amazing results pretty quick. I never thought I could get on Accutane because they say  &quot;Accutane is used to treat severe nodular acne&quot;. And while I had what I considered severe acne...I never thought it was &quot;that bad&quot;. But I decided to go back to my dermatologist and ask about it. My Dr. was extremely supportive and agreed that I was a good fit for Accutane since prior remedies were proven no longer affective. 
I&#039;ve now been on the drug three months and I just can&#039;t express how happy I am with it! Within a month my blackheads were gone!! That right there was amazing to me. My face is no longer oily and my &quot;breakouts&quot; are down to about 3 pimples (which will eventually become zero!). I haven&#039;t experienced any weird side effects. I started using moisturizer on my face DAY ONE. I think that was very important because I&#039;ve never had any bad dry patches on my face. 

My daily facial routine consists of:

CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion: applied to my face as soon as I get out of the shower in the morning (face still wet) or after washing my face at night. Works very well under my make up. 

I wash my face with Dove bar soap morning and night. 

For my lips I use Lanolin cream. WORKS WONDERS. Can be purchased at Target, grocery stores, Walgreens...

As a conclusion, I&#039;m extremely satisfied thus far with Accutane. My Dr. is recommending that I take the drug for a total of 6 months. 

I would be happy to answer any questions some of you may have! Just try it !""",10

After 2 weeks, the weight started dropping and hasn&#039;t stopped. Still NO side effects. My advice: if you are significantly overweight, that weight may be more dangerous to you that the possible side effects of this. While taking, continue periodic check-ins with your doctor and get blood work (at least quarterly). Take multi-vitamins. You still need to choose the right foods, but this will help you feel full with reduced portion sizes. Also, use one of the fitness apps!""",10

1) One of the biggest differences with tricyclic BC (3 months) from the once a month kind is the likelihood of spotting is much greater. On the first pack I spotted months 2-3. (yep..2 months pretty much). That being said it was so light I could&#039;ve probably used the same panty liner all day &amp; been fine. Also, my BF isn&#039;t a child &amp; wasn&#039;t bothered by it. I found it mostly annoying. The second pack I&#039;m still spotting but only for 1 month, also very light. I suspect it will not happen on the next pack. Minor nausea was my only other side effect. No libido change, no weight gain, mood change, etc. Not perfect, but I love it. It&#039;s going to be different for each person.""",10
71529,"""I just had the IUD Skyla inserted yesterday. I was very afraid from reading all the reviews. Honestly it was simple and fast. Yes there was a tiny bit of cramping which lasted about 8 seconds and my Dr warned me right before it was to happen. I had no cramping or pain after a little bit of spotting that evening and that was it. Best decision I made. I&#039;m very happy!!""",10
140529,"""Scoliosis and multiple herniated discs in both my neck and lower back have required quite a few spinal surgeries but left me in chronic pain. Over the years it has increased to the point where nothing was helping my pain. My pain Doctor started me on Fentanyl 100 and slowly raised it to 150 over the course of a few years. Currently I am able to control my pain to about a &quot;4&quot; out of 10, by adding Oxycontin for breakthrough pain. Drowsiness and constipation are the most annoying side effects but its worth it to get my life back to semi-normal.""",10
76856,"""For myself, I say it&#039;s been a wonder pill. All it does for me is it makes me normal after many years. Never knew it could be possible.  Shift work, odd hours, 30 years of bad intermitant sleep? NOT NO MORE!""",10
144012,"""Victoza is an amazing drug thank you. My insurance only covered trulicity it was garbage. At least for me,  my doctor gave me a 2 week trial the difference was day and night. On the first day Victoza bought my sugar from 169 to 125  second day 99. 3 day 98  it&#039;s a steady 90 I have been doing .6  not up to the 1.8 I will ask my doctor to see if a higher dosage is necessary. My doctor fought for me against my insurance (like they care) they gave me permission for one year. My diarrhea was mild and is subsiding no other symptoms I take my med at night and it stopped the morning spikes. Some people say headaches, maybe doing the night injections help,,, I don&#039;t get them This drug is a miracle thank you Denmark sad we Americans don&#039;t care""",10
18577,"""I&#039;ve taken Elavil for 14 yrs for irritable bowel syndrome and depression. I suffered with IBS for 5 yrs and had every test  possible and even had my gallbladder removed. It really makes me sleep but after taking it the 1st night, I KNEW it was the magic medicine for my irritable bowel syndrome. As long as I take 25mg each night, I have zero irritable bowel symptoms. It saved my life.""",10
144262,"""I think it&#039;s the best birth control around. I got mine inserted April 2011. You get it inserted once and don&#039;t have to worry for 3 years. It took my body a few months to get used to, so I had quite a bit of break through bleeding. Though other than that no full period of heaving bleeding since. 
I would suggest before trying this birth control, try others first and see how you fair with those. My first attempt at birth control was a progesterone only pill and it caused me to have severe mood swings, so I found out that wasn&#039;t for me. Also, your body needs about 3 months to get used to the additional hormones of whatever you take. 
So research and know the side effects, before you jump in head first.""",10
124792,"""I have been on this medication since July, and the results are simply amazing!  I have my life back, not only did I get so much relief from the pain in my legs, I can now walk and walk and actually keep up with my very active grandkids (age 4, 11, 11, and 16)  On a side note I have lost almost all my excess weight by tweaking my diet and just being able to be active again!  This medicine has been a Godsend to me!  Hope anyone who is suffering from this disease is able to get the same results I have, it is great to have my active life back!""",10
3570,"""I started using Zoloft on Wednesday the 5th of December 2012. Todays date is the 8th of Dember 2012. 4 days, it has only taken 4 days for me to feel like a new person. I have been on it before, therefore i know what side effects to expect. Everybody is different but i suffered from loss of appetite, headaches, nausea, a bit dizz, lower back pain, trembling hands. This only lasts for a week or two. I used to cry for no reason (even at work), snap at my partner for stupid things, i was paranoid over everything, socially scared (always wanted to stay home). I haven&#039;t cried since being on Zoloft, nor snap at my partner. I am a new person now. I&#039;m so happy and look forward to my new life.  100/100.""",10
31440,"""I had unprotected sex and he came in me twice. I was freaking out so he bought me the plan b. I know most freak out about it not working, but believe me relax. Three weeks after taking the pill, I got my period. I had no symptoms, but I did have weight gain and I craved food all the time.  But  during those three weeks were very stressful. But try not to stress. Think about other things and go on with your daily life. Things do end out ok in the end.""",10
61533,"""I&#039;ve been on Ortho Evra for 10 years...that&#039;s right...10 years!  I started when I was 17 and I&#039;ve never had a problem with it.  Periods are normal. Sometimes really bad cramps the first couple of days and maybe a headache or two.  But those are just normal PMS side effects as far as I&#039;m concerned.  I&#039;ve heard people have gained weight using Ortho Evra but I never had such issues.  And most of all, I&#039;ve never gotten pregnant. My only complaint is Ortho Evra is very expensive.  I&#039;m on an HSA now and I pay $79 per month. I wear the patch on my buttocks and I switch sides every week to avoid excess irritation.  Sometimes it gets stuck to my underwear or jeans and it&#039;s hard to find a replacement if it peels off.""",10
