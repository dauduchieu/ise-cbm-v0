Personally, I take Acyclovir, prescribed by my dermatologist, upon feeling the first tingle of a herpes cold sore.  I have found that It cuts the cycle in half.  Other people prefer Valtrex.  If you want real results during a herpes outbreak, you need an oral medication.  Keep it handy in your prescription cabinet.  Not a topical cream.  Herpes is an internal virus.

I experienced absolutely no weight change and my periods almost and when I did get my period they were painful, but they were so infrequent so it wasn&#039;t a concern. I noticed also that my acne got worse.

Bacteria in Vagina Can Affect Genital Herpes Transmission
The study suggests that healthy vaginal microflora may protect women from getting infected with genital herpes. The study has been led by  a doctoral student at the University of Texas Medical 
The experiment that was carried out in the laboratory compared various cultures that normally live in the vagina. Researchers found that the herpes simplex virus type-2 (genital herpes) replicated more in cultures that contained less Lactobacillus (were less healthy).

Insertion is best while you are in your menstrual cycle because it causes your cervix to dilate.

Insert gave a small cramp to my surprise much easier than I was setting myself up for in my mind.

My advice: Try taking Lexapro for at least one week. The first week you will feel tired, dizzy, and mildly nauseated. Those effects disappear very quickly.  Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks. I don&#039;t recommend using Lexapro without Buspar.  Anxiety/Panic will gradually disappear over two to four weeks.  Use Ativan or other Benzodiazapines sparingly until Lexapro is working.""",10

41092,"""I was diagnosed with Pemphigus years ago.  I was given all sorts of medication and this was the only one that got me a relief.  After 1-2 applications, my sores disappeared.  I used the ones given as samples to the specialist who treated me for the problem.  I used Synalar on my face and received intradermal shots in my head to take care of the numerous sores on my scalp.""",10
7823,"""I was on Prometrium from day 1 up until week 19 then I was placed on the Makena shot which is also progesterone until I was 36 weeks. I fully believe this is why I have my daughter today. She is almost two and has had no side effects from me taking this medication in pregnancy. I have MTHFR FACTOR  and low progesterone. This is why I needed to be on this medication""",10
34918,"""I was very apprehensive to take this medication because of all the negative reviews on this site and others, but I&#039;m telling you, TRY THIS PILL.
I&#039;ve literally tried every product, been to multiple doctors and dermatologist, have had facials, treatments, etc., etc... NOTHING has worked. Except this.
PROS: Started to control my acne(less &quot;patchiness&quot;, less breakouts), made my breasts grow almost a whole cup size bigger in the first 2 packs, made me more relaxed and chill then I already was, 4 DAY PERIODS.
CONS: the first pack I experienced constant spotting and really bad mood swings (only the first month, after the first pack I am more in control than ever)
I can now go to the dermatologist to fix my scaring and my skin will be perfect! good luck!""",10
20085,"""My experience with accutane is life changing my story will literally change lives for the simple fact that I am a kid that lived the same nightmare each and every high school kid has experienced at least once in there life and the fact that I can share what I did and that it could help millions of people is heartwarming I wish I could post pictures because this story just doesn&#039;t do it justice""",10
16932,"""I started to take Spintec about 3 years ago. I did not have any side effects. Prior to taking Sprintec, I had HORRIBLE periods: heavy cramping, heavy flow, etc. Sprintec reduced my cramping and heavy flow. I workout about 5 times a week so I didn&#039;t notice any weight gain. However, for almost 6 months, I stopped taking it because my prescription ran out and I had to go see my doctor. I also was not sexually active for those 6 months so I did not feel the need to be on it. I just started taking it again. I recommend Sprintec to every woman who wants a cheap, effective form of birth control. Just be aware that every body is different. Find what works for you.""",10
27949,"""The best for a diabetic type 1. IT&#039;s better than a needles four times a day. Now.it&#039;s only once a day!!
I think it&#039;s worth every penny. I would pay even if my insurance doesn&#039;t cover it. I went to alot of Doctors to get it. Most said no,but I kept trying. IT was worth it!!! DON&#039;t get it if you LOVE needles!!""",10
16909,"""I was on Seasonique for the past 4+ years.  I absolutely loved it.  I never spotted in between periods or had any other problems.  Before I started I had some minor breakouts, but once on the pill my face cleared up completely.  The only change I did have was prior to Seasonique I never cramped with any of my periods and while on the pill I had moderate/severe cramping for the first few days of all my periods.  Now my husband and I are trying to concieve and I have been off the pill for almost the last two months and I&#039;m still waiting for my first period to start.  I have been told this is normal once leaving any birth control.""",10

52153,"""I also found that Chantix was a miracle.  40  year smoker and 1 1/2 packs a day.  By Day 4 of starter week, I didn&#039;t feel the need to smoke.  However, I did seeing as I had the week to finish.  Have not had a cigarette since my starter week was over.  Do not have the urge at all.  I was one to panic when down to just a few cigarettes in my pack - but nothing.  I do have to admit I have gained 5 pounds in the three weeks that I have been on in it. That is to be expected.  No dreams or craziness.  I do have more gas than usual - glad that it may be related to drug.  Thank you Chantix.  """,10

47335,"""This medicine saved me.  Starting about the age of 15 I began to experience menstrual cramps for the first time.   It was the very worst pain I had ever felt at that time.  Not content to only hurt in my lower abdomen the pain radiated all the way down the front of my legs to my ankles.  I couldn&#039;t sit still.  All I could do was pace back and forth crying.  I couldn&#039;t find a single pain reliever that worked; we had the usual in the house, aspirin, ibuprofen, even Midol.  Finally my mother became so worried she took me to the doctor.  I thought I was going to have to be on some kind of strong prescription medication.  What does he do, he returns to the room with about 50 samples of Aleve and it has been my miracle drug ever since.""",10
13161,"""This is the only nasal spray that I&#039;ve used over the last 25 years. I hope the product never gets discontinued.  It is effective with minimal side effects.  I don&#039;t leave home without it - ever.  It&#039;s a good product.   As with all nasal sprays, overuse will get you addicted.  Just use it twice a day as directed and it will be effective.""",10

17493,"""PEOPLE PLEASE DONT COME HERE TO GET FEAR INSTILLED IN YOU ABOUT THIS MEDICINE. Other People experiences may NOT EVER happen to you. I didn&#039;t take it for a whole year because of these kind of websites.. Let&#039;s put this out there I DO NOT LIVE A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. I eat fried food, I eat out a lot (hence, why I think I got the bacteria) I barely workout and I&#039;m considered overweight. (NOT BRAGGING JUST BEING TRUTHFUL) And the medicine still worked for me. If your dealing with horrific side effects 9/10 you we&#039;re probably dealt with those things one or another without medication. For the nausea (eat 1/2 a toast before taking it) For the insomnia ( don&#039;t take it right before you go to bed 2-3 hours in advance) Metal taste goes away after you eat""",10
23080,"""I had my implanon inserted September 17th 2012. Before that I had a baby June 30th 2012. So im not so sure as to if I have gained weight from this product or from having a baby or even if it&#039;s from one or the other and im just overweight.  Anyways I had it removed in February this year 2015. I have to say this is a great form of birth control.  Never got pregnant on it. That was the whole purpose of having it inserted. The reason I decided to have it extracted is due to possible weight gain, mood swings, no period at all, and I did have a lower sex strive. Since I had it removed my mood swings got better,  I have more of a sex strive which I didn&#039;t think it was decreasing, and I didn&#039;t start my period till after I had my paragard inserted.""",10
33807,"""Started taking this drug about 3 months ago. It took about a month to completely clear up my chest and back acne. It had a significant effect on my facial acne. The cysts only last a couple days now and my face is noticeably clearer. Very happy with this result! The only side effect I personally am not super happy about is the weight loss. I am 5&#039;8&quot; and usually 125-130 pounds. Three months into this drug I now weigh 114 pounds and feel very tired all the time. I have tried drinking more water than usual and have increased my sodium intake which is helping with the light headed-ness. Otherwise I have not changed my eating habits and the pounds keep coming off. Not sure how to combat this beside stuffing myself.""",10
31299,"""I have been on the combo type of birth control since I was 16. I started with the ortho lo (the basic one in movies in the round case), Yaz came out and I switched to that, I was so tired of remembering to take a pill everyday, during my yearly pap my OBGYN told me about the patch I used it for a few years and I never gained weight on the pill or ring but for some reason the patch did make me gain some weight, I was always worried I put in the wrong spot and it wasn&#039;t going to work, taking it off weekly hurt like an extra strong bandaid and left purple gluey sticky stuff I had to scrub off with alcohol. After those years I was put on the ring. My weight went back to normal, I have no pain, Insert 3 weeks, period, insert again. So easy! Love it!""",10
36804,"""My doctor gave me a sample box as my insurance would not cover. After reading reviews this is what I did. Chilled water and Suprep, put Oragel on my tongue and mouth to deaden taste buds. Used a straw as far back as possible held my nose. Each time I stopped I drank orange Gatorade and put a little honey on my tongue. Only tasted a little strong cough syrup. It took effect about 30 minutes later and subsided in a couple of hours. I did this at 6 PM and 3 am procedure at 8:30 am. I wish I had some diaper rash ointment as the Vaseline did not quite do the trick with the burning. Did not have any severe reactions.""",10

Also I was always oily and still am sadly And going to the dermatologist to figure out how to deal with it. I&#039;m now 17 and I never wear makeup and religiously wash my face and use a toner. I went to the dermatologist Recently and they gave me a prescription of Aczone and it cleared my face up in about 1 and a half to 2 months. My face burned, purged, and dried (don&#039;t pick!!!!!!!)but it helped. You just have to stick with it and give yourself a Pep talk that it&#039;s worth it at the end.

49182,"""I had a mishap with my boyfriend on Sept.4 where he came inside of me and immediately ran to CVS to get the Plan B. I took the pill within an hour of the accident.  I&#039;m not sure whether it was a mixture of the Plan B and my regular birth control (which I started Sept.5) but the side effects hit me hard. I was extremely naseuas and fatigued. I mean to the point where any physical activity was draining. This went on for the next two weeks with mild cramping in between. The side effects subsided a bit but I am happy to say that my period came today Sept.29 only a day late! I am well over the &quot;weight limit&quot; for the pill and it worked for me and I was very fertile according to my ovulation calend. Hope this helps someone ease their minds a bit!""",10

Don&#039;t really remember what a full night of rest feels like.  To be honest   I was scared to take Humira  until I done my own research. On 2-11-2015  I had my first shot of Humira.  I&#039;m thinking this sucker is going to really hurt. Took me about 5 minutes to get my nerve up. Oh well I pushed the button and the rest is history. OMG!!!!!!!!! Why did I wait so long.  To me the shot doesn&#039;t hurt but it does sting just a little. 2 days after the shot. No pain in hips and sleeping all night. I still have some tightness in my lower back when I wake up. So far its a miracle.""",10

After horrible Effexor side effects I started on 5 mg of Lexapro again (I was absolutely desperate) and gradually increased. For the first two weeks this drug made my anxiety/depression way worse and I became delusional, but once I took a very small dose of seroquel I became progressively better each day and I have no symptoms of mental illness whatsoever anymore. Completely healed me of depression.""",10
